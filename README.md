Berserk engine is planned as powerful and compact toolkit for creating High Performance Applications.  
It will be written on C++ 11 with OpenGL graphics support, OpenAL audio, Bullet Physics, Asimp model importer, FreeImage texture loader and FreeType fonts loader.  
Engine will provide significant functionality in memory managing, math, strings manipulating, XML files loading, models exporting, multi-threading, image exporting, fonts and text visualisation, postprocess graphic effects and realistic rendering.

# Purpose

The idea is to implement a structure with common tools for creating real-time graphics applications with basic physical and audio functions. As a student interested in programming, I decided to try and expand my knowledge in the field of computer graphics and C ++.

The following books help me in the implementation of this project:

* Game Engine Architecture, 2nd ed. by *Jason Gregory* 
* Learn OpenGL, by *Joey de Vries*
* Real-Time Rendering, 3rd ed. by *Tomas Akenine-MÃ¶ller, Eric Haines and Naty Hoffman*
* The OpenGL Shading Language, 4th ed. by *David Wolff*
* ShaderX3: Advanced Rendering with DirectX and OpenGL, by *Wolfgang Engel*

# Features

* [Core features](https://github.com/EgorOrachyov/Berserk/blob/master/Documentation/BlankSheet.md) - A list of all core *engine* features.
* [To be added](https://github.com/EgorOrachyov/Berserk/blob/master/Documentation/ToBeAdded.md) - A list of features to be implemented in both near and far future.

# Documentation

* [Overview](https://github.com/EgorOrachyov/Berserk/blob/master/Documentation/BlankSheet.md) - An expanded description of *engine* architecture and core features.
* [Basics](https://github.com/EgorOrachyov/Berserk/blob/master/Documentation/BlankSheet.md) - Simple tutorial to start development with *Berserk*.
* [Advanced usage](https://github.com/EgorOrachyov/Berserk/blob/master/Documentation/BlankSheet.md) - Enhanced tutorial to dive in a complicated *engine* specialities.

 Progress (first version of the rendering engine, could be found in the archive) in the development of the rendering engine:

**WARNING: Engine is still in the earliest part of the development. It can differ from the final result.**
