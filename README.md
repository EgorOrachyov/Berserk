# BERSERK

**Berserk engine** is designed as a powerful and compact tool for creating high-performance applications.
It will be written in C++11 with support for OpenGL graphics, OpenAL audio, Bullet Physics, 
Assimp importer for models, FreeImage texture loader and FreeType font loader.


**The engine will provide** significant functionality in memory management, math, 
SIMD instruction set utilisation, working with strings, multi-threading, 
exporting/importing various kinds of resources (such as textures, geometry, audio files and etc.),
displaying fonts and texts, graphical post-processing effects and realistic visualization.

**At this moment** the global refactoring task needed to be done before any of
the planned engine feature will be done. Old project sources with screenshots and
descriptions could be found in more earlier commits. 

**Note**: project under heavy development. It is not ready for usage.
