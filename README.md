[![Build Travis](https://travis-ci.com/EgorOrachyov/Berserk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/EgorOrachyov/Berserk)

Berserk engine is designed as a powerful and compact tool for creating high-performance applications.
It will be written in C++11 with support for OpenGL graphics, OpenAL audio, Bullet Physics, 
Assimp importer for  models, a FreeImage texture loader, and a FreeType font loader.
The engine will provide significant functionality in memory management, math, SIMD instruction set utilisation, 
working with strings, loading XML files, exporting models, multi-threading, exporting 
images, displaying fonts and text, graphical post-processing effects and realistic visualization.

## Purpose

The idea is to implement a structure with common tools for creating real-time graphics 
applications with basic physical and audio functions. As a student interested in programming, 
I decided to try and expand my knowledge in the field of computer graphics and C++11.

The following books help me in the implementation of this project:

* Game Engine Architecture, 2nd ed. by *Jason Gregory* 
* Learn OpenGL, by *Joey de Vries*
* Real-Time Rendering, 4rd ed. by *Tomas Akenine-MÃ¶ller, Eric Haines and Naty Hoffman*
* The OpenGL Shading Language, 4th ed. by *David Wolff*
* ShaderX3: Advanced Rendering with DirectX and OpenGL, by *Wolfgang Engel*

## Features

* [To be added](https://github.com/EgorOrachyov/Berserk/blob/master/Documentation/Markdown/ToBeAdded.md) - A list of features to be implemented in both near and far future.

## Documentation

* [Overview](https://github.com/EgorOrachyov/Berserk/blob/master/Documentation/Markdown/BlankSheet.md) - An expanded description of *engine* architecture and core features.
* [Basics](https://github.com/EgorOrachyov/Berserk/blob/master/Documentation/Markdown/BlankSheet.md) - Simple tutorial to start development with *Berserk*.
* [Advanced usage](https://github.com/EgorOrachyov/Berserk/blob/master/Documentation/Markdown/BlankSheet.md) - Enhanced tutorial to dive in a complicated *engine* specialities.

## Additionally

 Progress in the development of the rendering engine. Features, represented in the screens: shadow mapping, 
 deferred shading, normal, diffuse and specular mapping, screen space ambient occlusion, tone mapping, 
 gamma correction, gaussian blur, god's rays, radial blur.
 (It is the first version of the engine, could be found in the archive):
